# About the example: Crop Avatar

- It's just a demo to show how the plugin work, not complete test.
- The `class.thumbhandler.php` file come from web, not so well for every cropping case.
- The demo was built on Windows 7, with the server of PHP 5.4.3 / Apache 2.2.22, and test on Chrome 34 / Firefox 30 / IE 11, maybe not work well on other platforms or browsers.
