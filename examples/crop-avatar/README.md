# About the example: Crop Avatar

- It's just a demo to show how the plugin work, not complete test.
- The `class.thumbhandler.php` file come from web, not so well for every cropping case.
- The demo was built on my computer (Windows 7 + PHP 5.4.3 + Apache 2.2.22 + Chrome 34 / Firefox / IE 11), maybe not work well on other platforms or browsers.
